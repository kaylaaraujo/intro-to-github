				<h1>About Us</h1>
			
				<h2>It all started...</h2>
				<p>David Segal was a 28-year-old tea loving entrepreneur. His cousin Herschel Segal was a Canadian retail pioneer. What did they have in common? A vision: great tea, a friendly environment and a colourful, modern store. It seemed like a simple idea, but they couldn’t find anyone else that was doing it. So they decided to take matters into their own hands. With David’s energy and enthusiasm and Herschel’s know-how, it was the perfect balance of youth and experience.</p> 
				
				<h2>Our Success</h2>
				<p>Our first store opened in 2008, on vibrant Queen Street in Toronto, Canada. Before long, first time customers became regulars, our neighbours became our friends and our store became a community fixture. And the same thing has happened at every new store since. Now you can find our tea shops in neighbourhoods and communities across Canada and the United States. And we’re not slowing down any time soon – we can’t wait to share the DAVIDsTEA experience with the whole world.</p>

				<h2>Who We Are</h2>
				<p>Walk into a DAVIDsTEA today and you can choose from over 150 types of tea, including exclusive blends, limited edition seasonal collections, traditional straight teas and exotic infusions from around the globe. Not to mention the largest collection of organic teas and infusions in North America.</p>

				<p>We’re seriously passionate about great tasting teas, and we have something to satisfy every palate and every craving. Looking for a sweet treat? Then you’ll love Read My Lips, our chocolate mint dessert tea, or Red Velvet Cake, a creation that tastes just like its namesake. Into something more traditional? Check out our premium green teas like Sencha Ashikubo or Dragonwell. And to help you make the best cup of tea possible, we also carry a line of innovative tea accessories designed in-house, from spoons and infusers to tea sets and travel mugs.</p>

				<p>So…why tea? Because it’s healthy, delicious and fun. Because it brings people together, all over the world. Because it’s the second-most popular drink on the planet, second only to water.</p> 

				<p>And, quite simply, because it makes us happy.</p>
